# Highrise Taxonomy UI
A WordPress plugin that allows you to register taxonomies with a different UI than the standard checkbox or tag search input. The plugin allows you to assign registered taxonoimes to support a select input or a radio button input. Both of these are useful for when you only want a user to be able to select one term.
